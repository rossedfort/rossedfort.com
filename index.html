          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <h5>I was born in Somerset, New Jersey in 1993. As a child I had many interests, including art, nature, music, athletics, and science. Growing up, I tried Soccer, Tennis, Golf, and Swimming, but my true passion was Diving. I was a Junior Olympic level diver, competitive at a national level. The highlight of my young athletic career was winning the Junior Olympic National Championship in 2006, when I was 13 years old. Around this time, my other extra-curricular interests flourished, and I was serious about Guitar and Photography.<br><br>In 2011, I decided to accept a scholarship to the University of Denver as a Division-I Diver, and full-time student. I studied Emergent Digital Practices, a blend of media, technology, art, and design. In this program I learned to use software such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Audition to create compelling pieces of digital art. My 4 years of Diving at a collegiate level taught me lessons in discipline, perserverence and teammwork. As a captain of the team for my final 2 years of college, I learned  how to lead a group of 25 swimmers and divers to success at a high level. Collegiate athletics taught me many valuable lessons, which are reflected in my professional career today.<br><br>Upon graduation in 2015, I was accepted to the Turing School of Software and Design, in Denver, Colorado. Turing is a 7-month developer training program, unlike any Dev Bootcamp in existence. Turing was a grueling but immensely rewarding academic endeavor, that not only taught me the technical skills necessary to become a developer, but the soft skills to thrive in any career. After finishing the program in March of 2016, I accepted a position at Wazee Digital, where I am a front-end software engineer today.</h5>
